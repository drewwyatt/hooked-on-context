# Hooked on Context

Keynote and Sample Code

## Keynote

## üìù Custom Font

Since most of the code samples in the keynote were copy/pasted from VSCode, they are in [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (a custom font ü§¶‚Äç). The code slides will probably look weird unless you [download and install it](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Sorry!
