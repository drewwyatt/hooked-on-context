# Hooked on Context

Keynote and Sample Code

## 💻 Sample Code

The sample code shown in the presentation can be found in [src/examples](https://github.com/drewwyatt/hooked-on-context/tree/master/src/examples).

## 🕹 Demo

The demo is built and published to Github Pages and can be found [here](https://drewwyatt.github.io/hooked-on-context/).

## 📺 Keynote

### 📝 Custom Font

Since most of the code samples in the keynote were copy/pasted from VSCode, they are in [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) (a custom font 🤦‍). The code slides will probably look weird unless you [download and install it](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). Sorry!

## 🔧 Downloading and Running

The examples are build with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can get off the ground using the default create-react-app commands. Namely:

first:

```bash
$ yarn # install dependencies
```

then:

```bash
$ yarn start # run the app locally
```

or:

```bash
$ yarn test # run tests
```
